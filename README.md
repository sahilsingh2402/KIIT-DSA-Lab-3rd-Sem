[x] QUES 1: WAP to find out the smallest and largest element stored in an array of n integers.
[x] QUES 2: WAP to reverse the contents of a dynamic array of n elements.
[x] QUES 3: WAP to search an element in a dynamic array of n numbers.
[x] QUES 4: WAP to sort a dynamic array of n numbers. 
[x] QUES 5: Given an unsorted dynamic array of size n, WAP to find and display the number of elements between two elements a and b (both inclusive).
[x] QUES 6: Given a dynamic array, WAP to print the next greater element (NGE) for every element. The next greater element for an element x is the first greater element on the
right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1.
[x] QUES 7: Let A be nXn square dynamic matrix. WAP by using appropriate user defined functions for the following: a) Find the number of nonzero elements in A. b) Find the sum
of the elements above the leading diagonal. c) Display the elements below the minor diagonal. d) Find the product of the diagonal elements.
