## Lab Assignment-3

- [x] QUES 1: Given an unsorted dynamic array arr and two numbers x and y, find the minimum distance between x and y in arr. The array might also contain duplicates. You may assume that both x and y are different and present in arr. 
- [x] QUES 2: WAP to arrange the elements of a dynamic array such that all even numbers are followed by all odd numbers. 
- [x] QUES 3: Write a program to replace every element in the dynamic array with the next greatest element present in the same array. 
- [x] QUES 4: WAP to sort rows of a dynamic matrix having m rows and n columns in ascending and columns in descending order. 
- [x] QUES 5: WAP to find out the k th smallest and k th largest element stored in a dynamic array of n integers, where 0<k<n. 
- [x] QUES 6: WAP to find the largest number and counts the occurrence of the largest number in a dynamic array of n integers using a single loop. 
- [x] QUES 7: You are given an array of 0 s and 1 s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array. Traverse array only once. 
- [x] QUES 8: WAP to swap all the elements in the 1st column with all the corresponding elements in the last column, and 2nd column with the second last column and 3rd with 3rd last etc. of a 2-D dynamic array. Display the matrix. 
- [x] QUES 9: WAP to store n employeeâ€™s data such as employee name, gender, designation, department, basic pay. Calculate the gross pay of each employees as follows: Gross pay = basic pay + HRA + DA; HRA=25% of basic and DA=75% of basic. 
- [x] QUES 10: WAP to add two distances (in km-meter) by passing structure to a function.

- Insert a node after a given data item
- Insert a node before a given data item
- Delete a node after a given data item
- Delete a node before a given data item
- Insert a node at the certain position (at beginning/end/any position).
- Delete a node at the certain position (at beginning/end/any position).
- Delete a node for the given key.
- Search for an element in the linked list.
- Sort the elements of the linked list
- Print the elements of the linked list in the reverse order.
- Reverse the nodes of the linked list.
- Print n th node from the last of a linked list.
- Delete the duplicate elements in a linked list.

## Lab Assignment-5

- [x] QUES 1: Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in a single linked list by using suitable user defined functions for each case. 
- Write a program to search an element in a simple linked list, if found delete that node and insert that node at beginning. Otherwise display an appropriate message.
- Write a program to find the middle node in a single linked list (without counting the number of nodes.)
- Write a program to reverse the first m elements of a linked list of n nodes.
- Write a program to check whether a given linked list is sorted or not.
- Given a linked list which is sorted, write a program to insert an element into the linked list in sorted way.
- Write a program to find the intersections elements of two linked list and store them in a third linked list.
- Write a program to modify the linked list such that all even numbers appear before all the odd numbers in the modified linked list.
- Write a program to check whether a singly linked list is a palindrome or not.
- A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list. Write a program to detect a cycle in a linked list.
- Write a program to reverse only even position nodes in a singly linked list.
- Write a program to swap kth node from beginning with kth node from end in a Linked List
- Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes. (where k is an input to the function). If a linked list is given as 12->23->45->89->15->67->28->98->NULL and k=3 then output will be 45->23->12->67->15->89->98->28->NULL.
- Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.
